## Introduction

This project aims to demonstrate the implementation and comparison of Decision Tree and SVM models. We will:

- Preprocess the dataset.
- Train Decision Tree and SVM classifiers.
- Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics.
- Compare the results and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm.

## Dataset

[**Specify your dataset here.**]

For example:

- The dataset used in this project is the [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- Or, "The dataset is a CSV file named `data.csv` located in the `data/` directory. It contains [describe the features and target variable]."

Provide details about:

- The source of the dataset.
- The features and target variable.
- The size of the dataset.
- Any preprocessing steps already applied (if any).

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    cd Model-Training
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    (Create a `requirements.txt` file using `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing your libraries)

    Example `requirements.txt`:

    ```
    scikit-learn
    pandas
    numpy
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    ```
